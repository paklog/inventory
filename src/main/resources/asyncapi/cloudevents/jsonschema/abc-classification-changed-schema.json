  "description": "Published when a SKU's ABC classification changes based on inventory analysis. ABC classification uses Pareto principle (80/20 rule) to categorize inventory: Class A items (top 20% by value, 80% of revenue), Class B (middle 30%), Class C (bottom 50%). This classification drives inventory policies including safety stock levels, reorder points, cycle count frequencies, and storage location assignments.",
